[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modal-rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modal-rails) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/modal-rails.svg?branch=master" />

modal-rails adds modal functionality to your Rails app. Here is how it works:

1) You open a modal from your frontend code
2) modal-rails fetches the modal contents from your specific modal controller actions with AJAX
3) The modal becomes visible for the user

modal-rails uses [iziModal.js](https://github.com/dolce/iziModal) to provide the modal engine.
