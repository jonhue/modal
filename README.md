# Modalist

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modalist.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modalist) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/modalist.svg?branch=master" />

Modalist is a powerful ajaxified modal solution for Rails. Here is how it works:

1) You trigger a modal opening from your frontend code
2) Modalist fetches the modal contents from your specific modal-controller-action with AJAX
3) The modal opens

Modalist does not reinvent the wheel and uses todays best modal-engine [iziModal.js](https://github.com/dolce/iziModal) to backup its code.

## Installation

Modalist works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'modalist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install modalist

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'modalist', github: 'jonhue/modalist'
```

## Usage

First let's add the necessary assets to your pipeline:

```js
//= require jquery
//= require iziModal
//= require modalist
```

```css
/*
 *= require iziModal
 *= require modalist.min
*/
```

**Note:** If you are using a package manager like Yarn, import the latest [iziModal](https://github.com/dolce/iziModal) and [modalist](https://github.com/jonhue/modalist.js) code instead.

Specify where modals should be located in your view:

```haml
!!!
%html
    %head
        -# ...
    %body
        = modalist
        = yield
```

### Controllers

Modallist simulates Rails' MVC structure. To add a new modal to your app you have to create a new controller action, route and view:

```ruby
class SettingsController < ApplicationController

    def index
        # a regular controller action
    end

    def modalist
        modalist
        # a modalist controller action
    end

end
```

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

    get 'settings', to: 'settings#index'
    scope :settings, as: :settings do
        get 'modalist', to: 'settings#modalist'
    end

end
```

In most cases you only want to allow AJAX requests to be able to reach your modal-controller-actions:

```ruby
get 'modalist', to: 'settings#modalist', constraints: Modalist::Ajax.new
```

### Views

In your Modalist views are a couple of helper methods available:

**`modalist_title(title)`:** This will specify a title for your modal. If you omit this in your view, your modal will not have a header. Takes a string.

**`modalist_subtitle(subtitle)`:** Add a subtitle to your modal header. Takes a string.

**`modalist_actions(&block)`:** Specify actions (preferably icons wrapped in links) which will be displayed on the right side of your modal header. Takes a block.

**`modalist_close`:** Renders a default modal close action. Can be passed to `modalist_actions`.

#### Example

```haml
- modalist_title 'Modal'
- modalist_subtitle 'Subtitle'
- modalist_actions do
    = modalist_close

Content ...
```

### Styles

To customize the styles of your modals, require the vendored default styles and then override them with your custom CSS.

It is often useful to be able to provide view-specific styles. Modalist therefore adds classes for controller and action to the `.modalist--content` element which wraps your modals content. Here is how you can utilize it:

```css
/* settings#modalist */
.modalist--content.settings.modalist {
    /* ... */
}
/* nested/settings#modalist */
.modalist--content.nested.settings.modalist {
    /* ... */
}
```
