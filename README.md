# Modalist

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modalist.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/modalist) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/modalist.svg?branch=master" />

Modalist is a powerful & lightweight (not necessarily but primarily ajaxified) modal plugin. Here is how it works:

1) You create a distinct Modalist object for every modal style.
2) You trigger a modal from your frontend code passing custom parameters
3) Modalist fetches the modal contents with AJAX while showing a loader (skippable if not desired)
4) The modal opens

## Installation

Modalist works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'modalist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install modalist

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'modalist', github: 'jonhue/modalist'
```

## Usage

First let's import the necessary assets:

```javascript
import Modalist from 'modalist';
Modalist.init();
let modalist = new Modalist;
```

```sass
@import "animate.css"
@import "modalist/src/modalist"
@import "modalist/src/modalist-theme"
```

Specify where modals should be located in your view:

```haml
!!!
%html
    %head
        -# ...
    %body
        = component 'modalist'
        = yield
```

### Controllers

Modallist simulates Rails' MVC structure. To add a new modal to your app, you have to create a new controller action, route and view:

```ruby
class SettingsController < ApplicationController

    def index
        # a regular controller action
    end

    def modal
        modalist
        # a modalist controller action
    end

end
```

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

    get 'settings', to: 'settings#index'
    scope :settings, as: :settings do
        get 'modal', to: 'settings#modal'
    end

end
```

In most cases you only want to allow AJAX requests to be able to reach your modal-controller-actions:

```ruby
get 'modal', to: 'settings#modal', constraints: Modalist::Ajax.new
```

### Views

In your Modalist views are a couple of helper methods available:

**`modalist_title(title)`:** This will specify a title for your modal. If you omit this in your view, your modal will not have a header. Takes a string.

**`modalist_subtitle(subtitle)`:** Add a subtitle to your modal header. Takes a string.

**`modalist_actions(&block)`:** Specify actions (preferably icons wrapped in links) which will be displayed on the right side of your modal header. Takes a block.

**`component 'modalist/closer'`:** Renders a default modal close action. Can be passed to `modalist_actions`.

#### Example

```haml
- modalist_title 'Modal'
- modalist_subtitle 'Subtitle'
- modalist_actions do
    = component 'modalist/closer'

Content ...
```

### Styles

It is often useful to be able to provide view-specific styles. Modalist therefore adds classes for controller and action to the `.modalist--content-body` element which wraps your modals content. Here is how you can utilize it:

```css
/* settings#modal */
.modalist--content-body.settings.modal {
    /* ... */
}
/* nested/settings#modal */
.modalist--content-body.nested.settings.modal {
    /* ... */
}
```
